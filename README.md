# jet-demos
These are Demonstration applications using Hazelcast Jet. Each is a full application and demonstrates how you can use Jet to solve real-world problems.

For smaller, feature specific samples see https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-code-samples

## Application Demos

* Riaz - PMML Model Importer and Executor

* Neil - Market Data Distributor

* Emin - Image Classifier

* Asim/Sancar/Basri/Talha/Mustafa -  Bitcoin Sentiment Real-Time Analysis

* [Online Training Traffic Predictor](./online-training-traffic-predictor) - Viliam/Ali

* [Jet Leopard](./jetleopard) - Ben Evans. This is a simple example of a sports book and is a good introduction to the Pipeline API. It also uses Hazelcast IMDG as an in-memory data store.

* Flight Telemetry - Reads a stream of telemetry data from ADB-S on all commercial aircraft flying anywhere in the world. There is typically 5,000 - 6,000 aircraft at any point in time. This is then filtered, aggregated and certain features are enriched and displayed in Grafana.

* Can - Markov Trees

## External Demos

* [Real-Time Trade Processing](https://github.com/oliversalmon/imcs-demo) Oliver Buckley-Salmon. Reads from a Kafka topic with Jet and then storage to HBase and Hazelcast IMDG. Shows enrichment and streaming aggregations. Jet 0.4.
